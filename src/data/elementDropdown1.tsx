    description:
      "Graphite is a versatile, naturally occurring form of carbon known for its excellent conductivity, lubricity, and thermal stability. Widely used in batteries (especially lithium-ion), refractories, and electrodes, it is essential in industries like energy storage, metallurgy, and electronics. Its unique properties make it indispensable for modern technologies and emerging applications like electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.",
